# react-hooks-v8

**Description**
The "react-hooks-v8" project is a collection of examples and experiments showcasing the usage of various **React hooks** such as **useRef**, **useId**, **useCallback**, **useLayoutEffect**, **useMemo**, and **useReducer**. Each hook is implemented in a separate file, with dedicated routes in the application to demonstrate its functionality and usage. The project serves as a learning resource for understanding how these hooks work and how they can be effectively used in React applications.

**Features**

- Dedicated routes for each React hook implementation.
- Examples demonstrating the usage and benefits of useRef, useId, useCallback, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, and useReducer.
- Clear explanations and comments in each file to aid understanding.
- Built with React and Vite for efficient development and fast bundling.

**Technologies Used**

- Frontend: React, Vite
- Routing: React Router
- Styling: CSS Modules
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

## Three.js Integration

The "react-hooks-v8" project also incorporates Three.js, a JavaScript library used for creating and displaying 3D graphics in a web browser. Three.js enhances the visual experience of the application by enabling the rendering of complex 3D scenes and animations directly within the React components. Leveraging Three.js opens up possibilities for creating immersive and interactive user interfaces, making it an ideal choice for projects requiring advanced visualization capabilities.
